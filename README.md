## Getting Started

### 1. Open the Project
This is a **static HTML/CSS/JS project** ‚Äî no installation required.  
Simply open `index.html` in a browser, or deploy via GitHub Pages.

### 2. API Keys (Optional)
Some threat intel sources require a free API key.  
To enable them:
1. Copy `config.sample.js` ‚Üí `config.js`
2. Paste your keys in `config.js`
3. Set `DEMO_MODE` to `false`
4. Keep `config.js` **out of Git** (already in `.gitignore`)

Without keys, the app still works with keyless APIs and demo data.

---

## Deployment
To publish on **GitHub Pages**:
1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Pages**
2. Set **Source** to `main` branch, root folder
3. Save and wait for the deployment URL

---

## Security Notes
- All tools run **entirely in the browser**  
- API keys (if added in `config.js`) are visible to anyone using your deployed page ‚Äî for production use, route through a serverless proxy  
- No sensitive data is stored; preferences are saved locally in the browser

---

## Roadmap
- [ ] CIDR calculator with IPv4/IPv6 support
- [ ] Org Planner: subnet planning + SIEM sizing
- [ ] More runbooks with industry mappings
- [ ] Offline-ready PWA version
- [ ] Serverless proxy for secure API key handling
